# Presentation 
**A collection of methods to analyse graphs**
In this project we define a Python Class able to create graphs and apply several methods.


**Main Features**
* Hamiltonian Cycle
* Is Eulerian
* Bread First Search
* Dept First Search 
* Dijkstra Algorithm
* Prims Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

# How to use it 
## Consultation Only
The `demo_graphizi.iypnb` file is a notebook that contains all the workflow for the project, with details, comments and results, therefore feel free to use it as an example and reuse some pieces of codes in your own projects.

## Executing the notebook
If you are interrested in executing this `demo_graphizi.iypnb` notebook and reproduce the results. 
* 1- Fork the repository 
* 2- Install dependencies 
* 3- Enjoy
